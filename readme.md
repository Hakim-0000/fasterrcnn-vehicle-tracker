# Vehicle Detection in Traffic Dataset using Faster R-CNN

This web app built for the purpose of deploying the machine learning model. The model trained using.
### Reminder
This web app was built for detecting **Vehicle on a Traffic**, so if your images or video isn't related to **Traffic**, you might get bad results or even doesn't get predicted object at all.

This web apps might be slow because it is using the ```'cpu'``` as device.
